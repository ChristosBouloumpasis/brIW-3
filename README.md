# BrIW (that doesn't work very well)
This Python program is a 'tea' round making application. (You can't make a round just yet!)

*You can add people, drinks and preferences.
*Starting a round is as simple as running the menu option.
*For anyone with a preference, they will be able to join the round.
*The creator can close the round and will receive a list of people and their desired drinks.

*Put the kettle on*
